# Road Traffic Accident Severity Classification

The severity of road traffic accidents depends on many factors including various attributes of the involved vehicles, drivers, casualties as well as surrounding conditions. The aim of the project is to build prediction models, based on these factors, to classify the severity of accidents (slight injury, serious injury or fatal injury). The dataset used in the project has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents in the year 2017-2020, collected from Addis Ababa sub city police departments. Sensitive information have been excluded during the data encoding process. The final dataset has information on 12316 accidents, each with 32 features.
